## 09/09/2024 - Trying to Connect JS to PostgreSQL

My objective is MAKE a CRUD using HTML/CSS/Javascript, but it's doesn't possible cuz common uses is in NODE.JS (framework) by __pg, express (libraries)__

The better way to do that is using LOCAL STORAGE for a starter like me! 

My studies at while are in BASICS and PROGRAMATION LOGIC. For now... But, for do that exercise is LOCAL STORAGE same.

### KNOWLEDGE NOW
- HTML (Forms, general settings) 
  - Deficit: Tables
  - Another tags...
- CSS (Normal Dependencies)
  - General Reset
  - Variables
  - Box, flex (a less)
  - fonts, colors, shadow
  - animation and display
- Javascript
  - Catch item
  - Functions less (addEventListener too)
  - Create Element
  - Programming Logic
- PostgreSQL
  - Concept Model
  - Logic Model
  - Relationship Model
  - CREATE TABEL
  - Do Queries
  - Join
  - Indexes (on going)
